## Summary
When comparing the results of the product reviews, there does not seem to be any kind of positive bias from the Vine (Paid) reviews. Overall the Vine reviews actually had a lower percentage of 5-Star reviews (31.9%) comapred to the products with Non-Vine (Unpaid) reviews (51.8%). This seemingly means that the money did not affect the outcome of the customer review.

This result could however be skewed for by a number of uncontrollable factors. I believe an additonal analysis that would help calrify any bias would be a Star-rating distribution of Vine and Non-Vine reviews. Basically comparing how many and the percentage of 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5-Star reviews appeared in both Vine and Non-Vine reviews. This would better help determine if there was an overall postive bias to the Vine reviews instead of allowing only the 5-Satar reviews to be the factor.
